angular-drills
==============

Set-up
------

You need somewhere to place `index.hml` so it can be accessed in your browser.

If you don't have a local http server running, I recommend using nginx http://wiki.nginx.org/Main.

Doing the drills
----------------
Clone or for the repository.
Checkout the tag you want to work on. Tags are listed below (in each part). All tags are named "x.y" with x the part number and y the drill number.

Part 1 - Working in the view
----------------------------

The aim of "Angular drills part 1" is to focus on the view by using native angularJS directives, to play with UI states and to resist the temptation to use controllers or directives.

During part one, all drills have to be performed `without the use of any controller or custom directive`.

List of drills (with tags):
- 1.1: Filtered ng-repeat
- 1.2: Filtered ng-repeat (2)
- 1.3: Nested ng-repeat with filters
- 1.4: Filtering objects by field
- 1.5: Counting filtering results
- 1.6: Adding controls and bootstrap css
